I'm going to try out ZSH again. I do feel like my bash config is getting a big
slow and I want to see if zsh can improve that. I'm also really interested in
learning how to use the directory expansion feature as well.

Along with this I'm going to attempt to use tmuxinator or consular to start
using tmux in a smart way, instead of just for tabs.

For now I'm using [Prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto) for config
instead of [oh my zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) just due to
the fact that prezto had the [pure](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure) prompt
theme built in (which I have wanted to try for a while). It's working well so
far. Tomorrow I'm going to work on consolidating all of my bash config and
moving my aliases to a shell-neutral location.
