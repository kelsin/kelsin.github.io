I created a tiny gem to help me out with this blog tonight. It's call
[QuickMug](https://github.com/Kelsin/quickmug) and it's meant to help me out
with uploading images to [SmugMug](https://github.com/Kelsin/quickmug).

When I want to upload an image I can now just run:

``` bash
quickmug upload ESports.jpg Me playing at a Sc2 tournament
```

QuickMug will upload that image with the specified caption and then return the
following as output:

```
[![Me playing at a Sc2 tournament](http://kelsin.smugmug.com/Other/Blog/i-qcn7dTc/0/Th/ESports-Th.jpg)](http://kelsin.smugmug.com/Other/Blog/i-qcn7dTc/0/L/ESports-L.jpg)
```

Then if I paste that into my blog I get the following:

[![Me playing at a Sc2 tournament](http://kelsin.smugmug.com/Blog/i-qcn7dTc/0/Th/ESports-Th.jpg "Me playing at a Sc2 tournament")](http://kelsin.smugmug.com/Blog/i-qcn7dTc/0/L/ESports-L.jpg)

I also aliased this to `qm` so it's even easier to use!
