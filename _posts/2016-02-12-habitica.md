## Why I Love It

I really like the distinction between habits (which aren't scheduled at all) and dailies (which have numerous options on how to schedule them. Normal todo lists don't handle things like cat litter and laundry very well, where this app handles them flawlessly.

The mobile app works very well and allows me to edit tasks on the go.

Being part of a party allows my progress to help (or hurt) the group which makes me more inclinded to do the things. I also want to collect all of the pets, so motivation while solo is also there.
