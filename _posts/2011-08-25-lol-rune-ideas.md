Here are a few rune builds that I'm looking forward to trying.

## Kennen

AP Glyphs and Quint's since they are the best ones. I went with Magic Pen marks
for more damage and dodge for seals but I might try out AP seals if the dodge
doesn't seem helpful.

## Tanks

All defense except for marks.

## Annie

Just like the Kennen build but with mana regen instead of dodge.
