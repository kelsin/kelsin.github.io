<p>We went to the gym again today. For now we really want to try and start a Sat/Sun/Tues/Thurs schedule. The only issues are Tues and Thurs mean really early morning if we want time for cardio and strength training (which I really want to keep doing).</p><p>Today was pretty much the same as yesterday but I used 4 upper body machines and did 4 sets of 5 reps instead of just 20 in a row. It's so weird how you can be extremely tired from one machine, but then the next machine you're perfect fine cause it's using different arm muscles.</p><p>Anyway, short and simple post but going to try and keep it up.</p><p>In other news we bought a electric fondue pot, and chocolate mix and cheeses. So tomorrow is going to be cheese fondue followed by chocolate fondue. I know very different strain from the gym, but it's valentines day... not that we wouldn't do that dinner any other day of the year.</p>
