I'm really interested in trying some AD carries. I'm loving Ashe but want to
give Vayne a try. I don't like Fortuna's design but I should try her. Last I'm
going to try Tristana who I already love but want to play more now that I know
more about the game.

For support I'm really liking Janna but also really want to try Karma.  I'm also
goign to give Morgana a try as a mage that can also shield.

Last but not least I really want to try Orianna. I can't WAIT to try controlling
the ball. It seems wicked awesome!
