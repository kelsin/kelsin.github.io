I was interested in
[Android: Netunner](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/124742/android-netrunner)
since the reimplementation came out. People at work immediately started forming
tournaments and game nights around the game and since I love cards games and
love the theme I figured I would like it. I immediately bought the core game but
didn't find time to learn how to play until the past few weeks.

Since then I've bought every expansion that's out so far and I've had a blast
playing against my wife almost every night. Until today I haven't ever played a
deck that wasn't a starting deck. While super fun and entertaining... the real
meat of the game is making decks. Tonight I finally sat down and created 4 decks
(I own 2 core sets so this is easily possible) that I'll be playing for bit to
get a feel for some of the expansion cards.

I'll try to make a couple of posts this week showing the decks that I'll be
trying.

My wife normally plays runners and loved the idea of
[dinosaurus](http://netrunner.meteor.com/card/dinosaurus-cyber-exodus) so I
found a deck online to use. This is the non-starter deck I've gotten to play and
so far it's great fun. The idea of tutoring to find the icebreakers you need is
awesome and dinosaurus is wicked cute!
