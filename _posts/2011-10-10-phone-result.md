So I ended up buying a new iPhone 4s on the apple website.

I couldn't see myself paying upwards of $300-$450 for an iphone 4 (buying one
completely new out of contract on ebay or through AT&T etc).  That just didn't
make sense.

What I would LOVE to do is buy a new phone completely out of contract so I
wouldn't have to renew but then the cost becomes $500-600 for any new phone
(iPhone or not). This is just ridiculous. I feel like I'm avoiding contract
troubles by paying more money to the people I want to be avoiding anyway.

So in the end, I do the only logical thing... which is exactly what all of these
contracts and pricing structures are setup to do. I buy the newest phone, out of
contract which also RENEWS my contract screwing me for when the iPhone 5 comes
out.

So it seems like until our government wakes up and starts instating laws that
actually help people (not likely) AT&T will keep winning while providing shitty
service.

Edit: I also looked into canceling AT&T and switching to another carrier but
with my wife and I on a family plan that involves paying TWO canceling fees and
stuff like that. It doesn't work out financially.
