Today was the first day of the new
[Hearthstone](http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/) beta season.

## Constructed

I started by playing some constructed. The games went pretty easy and I used my
main aggro warlock deck for all of the games. I haven't lost a game yet and
currently sitting at rank 21. I want to go slow however since all of the former
Legendary players are rank 17ish... don't want to rush and just start losing all
night!

I'm eager to see what happens however. Are the pros going to get to Legendary
quickly? Are some of them going to stall out at lower ranks due to the amount of
people in the game? Either way I'm very excited for the ranked/season rewards to
be implemented... hopefully soon!

## Arena

After those few constructed games to complete my quests I moved onto an arena
run. I choose Druid and got a pretty good deck. I think I had 5 Druid of the
Claws which is pretty fun.

The run went 5-3 which for me is very good. Rewards were a pack, 60 dust and 50
gold.

The games I lost I think I did due to not being efficient enough with my
cards. The last game was the most annoying since I had to drop out very
early. It was against a warlock and I had a few early mistakes that definitely
slowed me down enough to lose :frowning:

At this point it's already 10 so I'm going to head to read and bed (with some
Bullet Journal day-planning as well!)
