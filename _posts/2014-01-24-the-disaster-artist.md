I probably want to right a longer post about
[The Room](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368226/) at some point... but for now I
just want to mention that I finished
[The Disaster Artist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17404078-the-disaster-artist)
and it was a GREAT read. As someone who was seriously interested in how this
movie got made... this book delivers.

The narration is split into two stories. The first tells the story of how
[Greg Sestero](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0802995/?ref_=tt_cl_t3) (the author)
meets [Tommy Wiseau](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1382072/?ref_=tt_cl_t1) and the
second describes the making of The Room from the night before the first day of
shooting. Eventually the first story catches up to the second and the book
ends. It's an amazingly funny ride. Definitely watch the movie before reading
the book (Otherwise a lot of things won't make sense and won't be nearly as
funny as they should).

Later on I'll make another post about why I think The Room succeeded as much as
it did... there's definitely something special about it despite how horrible it
is. I've been thinking and taking notes on this... so I'll put that into the
blog in the future.
