(Don't watch the video at the top of that article if you don't like watching planes crash. I shouldn't have watched it).

The relevant piece of information here was that my new Macbook Pro was on that plane:

I was hoping my laptop was just on another plane but an email from Apple confirmed my fears. My original laptop definitely died in a fire over in Japan. My order now has a new $0.00 laptop on it that's being processed (not shipped yet). The email said the new laptop would be expedited but the order page still says 2-4 days for building and then 2-5 days for shipping. I hope that's not true but I will call later to find out for sure.

Edit: Guy on the phone wasn't very helpful and basically just said that it's just like me placing a new order today. It will be built in 2-4 days then shipped out. It was pretty clear that he couldn't do anything about that so I left it at that. Just sucks, I'm not a patient enough guy to wait another weekend. There are only so many Logic Studio videos I can watch online.
