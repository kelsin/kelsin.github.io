Just had my phone stolen out of my car while traveling in Ithaca.  Accidentally
left the car unlocked (didn't think I did) and accidentally left the phone in
the car.

The worst part about this? Due to normal cell phone contract bullshit, to get
the SAME PHONE I HAD I now have to pay 399.99... I paid $200.00 for the phone
new of course. Complete bullshit.

Notes for others: always have a passcode on your phone. That way the people who
steal it can't wipe it before you are able to use the location features to find
the phone :-(
