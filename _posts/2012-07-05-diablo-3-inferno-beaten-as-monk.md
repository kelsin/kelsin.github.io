So I've been working my way through Diablo 3's Inferno. I got INSANELY
lucky during Act 2 of Inferno when I found... well I found the best bow
I've ever seen in game period. It sold for 500 mil on the AH and I was
able to gear out myself and my wife with some pretty great gear.

Clearly I was making my way through Act2 already but it would have taken
a lot of farm without the amazing bow sale. That being said I also
probably over paid on some of the gear I bought due tohaving enough
money to do so.

The whole time I used this effective health calculator to tune my
gear: [http://rubensayshi.github.com/d3-ehp-calculator/\#intro](http://rubensayshi.github.com/d3-ehp-calculator/#intro)

In Act 1 I largely used a
[standard combination strike build](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/calculator/monk#bWgXYQ!XgU!ccabcc). Once
I got to act 2 I got way more
[defensive](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/calculator/monk#bWgXYh!XYU!ZZacca).

Basically during Act 2 and Act 3 I got a small amount of life per spirit
spent on a helm and with that I was able to use Transcendance to heal
myself up by spamming the mantra during combat. It worked really really
well. Unfortunately enemies started out dpsing my healing soon after
(and I started getting more VIT which doesn't help). After Act 3 and Act
4 the "keep your health pool low so that your LoH, heals and LoSS are
more effective" didn't work for me anymore so I had to switch it up.

That's when I found
[Cyclone](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/calculator/monk#aSgXYQ!XaU!acabcc)! This is
the build I used in Act 3 and 4.

Cyclone works by making sweeping wind even better. I always liked
sweeping wind as free damage that I didn't have to think about while
worrying about other stuff from mobs. Cyclone just improves this by a
ton. This build (leaving the DPS to Cyclone and improving my LoH with
thunder strikes) got me through Diablo.

There are packs in Act 4 that I had to skip... stupid Oppressors and
Subjegators, and I need to go back and beat it solo (did it with my
wife) but I'm very happy with where my monk is now.

There are two things on the monk todo list now:

**2H**: I want to try out some 2h builds. I love the look of the Diabo's
and I want to buy one while they are still cheap (if some of our damage
abilities get buffed they might not be cheap for long).

**Clear ALL THE THINGS**: I want to improve life and spirit regen so
that I have a good chance of beating these Act 4 packs.
