This morning I was REALLY happy when I woke up to a UPS tracking email saying the laptop would get here tomorrow! Then at about 10:30am the tracking info removed the estimated date. I got worried.

Turns out the laptop got held up by the Alaskan volcano erupting ash. I wish I was kidding:

How nuts is that...

EDIT: UPS guy on the phone says the package has cleared customs in paperwork, but they don't have the pallet that it's on et (over in Alaska) so it's staying "Exception" until they get it in theirs hands so they can guarantee a date. Right now he's saying it's scheduled for Monday so just delayed enough so I don't have it for this weekend. The weekend I have at home with nothing to do... oh well. At least the whole idea was to be portable so I can bring it with me to parents house next weekend right?
