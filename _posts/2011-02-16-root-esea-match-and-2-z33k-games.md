<p>So last night the first match was me vs ROOTslush (from ROOT gaming). I was super excited to be able to play pros that I watch on a regular basis. My teammate Rob played ROOTCatZ.</p><p>The matches were both fast. The first game was on iCCup Match Point. Slush 10 pooled (I think) and while I held it, it set me back. I then made a weird decision to expand even though he hadn't yet. He then attacked with a ton of roaches and won.</p><p>The second game I picked iCCup Valhalla. Slush did a roach build with very fast burrow and roach speed which worked great. He came and attacked and while I "held" it via two spine crawlers and my own roaches while I got an expansion up he eventually just had too many roaches and was able to kill me. He was constantly picking off one of my roaches via targetting and then burrowing again. I didn't have any detection this early in the game. It was pretty effective. I actually copied the build in my one ladder game (just happened to be zvz) and won!</p><p>After the ladder game I played in the NE Sc2 League online qualifier #1 and got beat pretty quickly by a 5 gate. I was a standard game for me cause I forgot to pull guys off of gas and got supply blocked so I had no hope of holding off the 5 gate.</p><p>Lastly I played my z33k league match vs Zoltan (3k master terran who is 3-0 [not 4-0] in my group). The first game was on Lost Temple and we got close positions. He bunker rushed and while I killed the svc and one marine, he got 3 more marines and 5 svcs to come and finish the bunker and I quit.</p><p>The second game I got close positions on Metalopolis and he assumed I was going to 14 hatch again so he built a bunker at my natural. I'm so bad when this happens. I see the bunker, send guys to attack it then realize I have 500 minerals. I need to build my pool RIGHT away if something is blocking the hatchery but I never remember that first thing. He eventually just ran the building scv away and then canceled the bunker so I got my hatch down. Then later he pushed with 3 tanks and marines and I just didn't have enough to hold it at all. Spines are worthless vs tanks and roaches and lings can't get close to the tanks without taking heavy losses so I just need A LOT more units from better macro up until that point to matter.</p><p>At this point it was enough loses to make me not want to play anymore. I want to get more ladder games in tonight so we'll see if that happens. I'll also try to update this post with some shots from the games later as well.</p>
