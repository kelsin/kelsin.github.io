Recently I've started brushing up on C++. I haven't programmed in it seriously
since college. After enlisting the helpt of local C++ experts I found the
following books to use.

### [A Tour of C++](https://www.amazon.com/Tour-2nd-Depth-Bjarne-Stroustrup/dp/0134997832)

Written by the author of C++ this book gives a brief intro to all of the
features of C++ and most of it's standard library. As a starting point it was a
big help getting my feet wet. After an initial read through I returned it to the
library in favor of the Primer down below.

### [Effective C++](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Specific-Improve-Programs-Designs/dp/0321334876)

This book is a great guide on some of the best practices for the language. It's
the main book I used after speeding through the tour book above. It's a fun read
and every tip is extremely practical.

### [Effective Modern C++](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Modern-Specific-Ways-Improve/dp/1491903996)

This book is similar to the last one except it spefically targets new C++/11 and
C++/14 features.

### [C++ Primer](https://www.amazon.com/Primer-5th-Stanley-B-Lippman/dp/0321714113)

This is the book I'm using as a reference. When reading through the effective
books if I don't understand a specific library funtion or syntax I pull this
out.
