I finally bought a [3DS](https://www.nintendo.com/3ds/new-nintendo-3ds/) and
with it
[Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate](http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/monster-hunter-4-ultimate-3ds). So
far the game is pretty great. I love the idea that you don't level, but just
slowly craft better and better items. I also like the idea that different items
/ equipment sets can be better on different monsters.

So far my favorite weapons are the Dual Blades, but I also really liked both the
Charge Blade, the Switch Axe and the Bow. I will have to play more to see what I
end up likeing most.

If anyone out there wants to play sometime definitely send me a message on
Facebook and we can exchange friend codes!

Unfortunately today I had to leave work early due to feeling sick and ended up
sleeping all afternoon (which is good). I was only able to play Monster Hunter
for a few hours in the evening after dinner. Will try to get more time in over
the next few days.
