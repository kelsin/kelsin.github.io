I'm ***REALLY*** good at buying things, so when I made the decision to try an analog
journal for daily notes I got immediately excited about buying both the journal
and accessories for it!

## Journal

I settled on a large [Moleskin](http://www.moleskine.com/en/) squared hardcover
which looks like this:

Since I'm so good at buying things I also bought a large hardcover plain paper
journal (as a sketchbook) and a Hobbit theme'd ruled journal just because it
looked awesome. It also features some pictures from the original illustrations
in the front. Here's the hobbit version:

## Pen

For my pen I choose a
[Uni-ball Jetstream RT 0.7mm](http://www.amazon.com/uni-ball-Jetstream-Retractable-Roller-70877/dp/B002FSZP5A/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1388971076&sr=8-1&keywords=uniball+RT+jetstream)
which I picked after reading
[a great blog post about the best pens](http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/the-best-pen/). Here
is one of mine:

## Pen Holder

I was first interested in the
[Quiver series](http://www.quiverglobal.com/). After more looking I found a much
[cooler, cheaper alternative on Etsy!](https://www.etsy.com/transaction/174056203?ref=fb2_tnx_title)
I ordered a orange, double pen holder for this Etsy artist. I can't wait to get
it!

## Bag

If I'm going to be carrying a journal I'll need to start carrying a bag with me again. I'm going to try and find my lain messenger bag that I got YEARS ago at an anime convention:

![Lain Bag](https://phaven-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/files/image_part/asset/1075344/snrXC3WVhp7um881D5pAd751g_s/medium_m2Ud2M_n8wuqxisxRqCDOrg.jpg)

If I can't find that I'll probably buy another cool geeky bag somewhere.

## Bookmarks

I also just ordered some
[3"x3" origami paper](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007OM5E80/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
to use with
[this pattern](http://pannonica.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/corner-bookmark-diagrams1.pdf)
in order to make colored corner bookmarks. This should help find special pages
in the journal (in addition to the normal moleskin ribbon bookmark to the
current date.) I might also try some
[other patterns](http://www.instructables.com/id/Origami-bookmark-Better-than/).
