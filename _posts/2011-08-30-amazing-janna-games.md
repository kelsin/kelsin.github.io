I had some GREAT games last night as Janna in League of Legends. I was playing
full support. I would take the AD hero and lane with them. I focused on keeping
the enemies away from my partner and shielding him everytime they tried to
harass. THE SHIELD IS SO GOOD!I basically nullify any harass. My AD partners
weren't even good! I can't wait to try this with a GOOD player that can farm!

I won three games in a row as Janna and I definitely think it was due to me
trying to get everyone to group up constantly after the laning phase was
done. We made good pushes and just destroyed the other teams each time!

Can't wait to get home and play some more!
