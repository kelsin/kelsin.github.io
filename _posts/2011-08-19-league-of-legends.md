I've started to try this game. Honestly I love the graphics and a lot of friends
play this game (even though original [DotA](http://www.playdota.com/) or
[HoN](http://www.heroesofnewerth.com) are probably the better games).  Last
night I decided to buy the digital collectors pack since it feels like a good
deal, comes with the special annie skin, and includes basically every hero I
wanted to try. I someone own Corki (no idea how), I also own Tristana (don't
know why, assuming the recent facebook promotion gave me the hero +
skin?). After buying the collectors pack I also picked up Ashe (seems like a
good one to have) and Nunu (cheap!)  via IP points and Kennen (he was on sale
and cute) via left over RP. I still have 1.9k RP left over for more skins later
on!

This morning I built a
[spreadsheet linking to guides](https://docs.google.com/a/valefor.com/spreadsheet/pub?hl=en_US&hl=en_US&key=0AtRzbAiXrK3edFRIRkpNLW84cFNxOVlhYkR
HdkhBS0E&single=true&gid=1&output=html) that I would use depending on my role on
the team.

For each role I bolded the character I would like to try most right now, and
then italicized the characters I would try next (due to bans later on, or just
not enjoying the character I bolded). I'm sure this spreadsheet will change a
lot due to me getting more heros, and due to me actually playing the game.

I'd used
[this guide](http://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/build/5-champs-you-should-know-how-to-play-aka-who-do-i-buy-next-70445)
to come up with most of the choices, and to figure out that I wanted to buy this
pack.

## Tanking

I think the turtle is cute so he's going to be my first pick. I would probably
try Amumu next and Cho'Gath (standard dude) after that. I was going to possible
try Amumu first since people say he's great, but since he's banned a lot in
ranked games I decided Rammus might be a better choice.

## AD Carry

Tristana and Teemo are too cute to pass up! I got the Riot Girl Tristana skin
due to the facebook promo so I'm going to start there.

## AP Carry

Annie and Kennen for the same reasons as above. There are so many characters in
these roles that picking ones that are cute seem fine! I got the goth annie skin
in the collectors pack and Kennen was on sale so I bought him as well. I didn't
buy a Kennen skin since honestly his skins are not very cool... I like his
purple outfit just fine.

## Supporter

The guide talked about Janna a lot for this so I'm going to try her first with
the big cow dude being my second choice!

## Offtank + Jungle

Warwick seems like a common choice for both roles so I'm going to choose him
first. My roommate likes playing him so I'm not expecting to play this a lot. I
would try Alistar or Amumu (maybe even Nunu since I bought him) after this.

I can't wait to play more! If anyone has any advice about these choices or wants
to play just let me know. Send a friend request to "Kelsin" in game!
