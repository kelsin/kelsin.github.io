Today I finally got to play [Twilight Imperium](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/12493/twilight-imperium-third-edition) for the third time. We only ended up with 4 players so I definitely want to play some more. We also had some expansion stuff mixed in and I'm actually very interested in playing the 6 player game with only the base rules / cards / races. Will probably end up buying my own copy at some point to make that happen.

I also finally won [Bang: the dice game](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/143741/bang-dice-game) as the renegade which was a satisfying way to end the day.
