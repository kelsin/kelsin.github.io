I played a ton of team games tonight. A bunch of different 2v2,3v3 and 4v4 games
got played and I ended up with a diamond 4v4 team and a masters 3v3 team! SO
AWESOME! This makes me really happy. During season one I didn't get past
platinum in teams (I think). This is working out much better!

I need to practice 1v1 but still get scared of it even though I know I
shouldn't. I will probably try to fit some in tomorrow after work. I do feel my
macro is getting better but there is a ton of refinement left to do still. Plus
scouting is still a major problem for me. It's easier in teams when you have
teammates who can scout ;-)

The best part is the last game. I had to leave and pick up my wife so I left
probably a bit earlier than I should and immediately left the house. When I left
we had just lost a HUGE battle in the middle and we all basically had nothing. I
was sure the game was over. Later on when I get back home I have a skype message
saying that the 3rd member of the team actually ended up winning and that's how
we got into masters....  TOTALLY RIDICULOUS!
