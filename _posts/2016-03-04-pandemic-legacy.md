We played our first game of [Pandemic Legacy](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/161936/pandemic-legacy-season-1) the other night and lost it miserably. I feel like I'm very out of shape when it comes to pandemic and this version of the game provides some extra challenges. Only being one game in, I haven't seen many of the special features of the game but it made me want to play again in a way that pandemic has not done in a long long time!
