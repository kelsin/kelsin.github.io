I got my [Geekhack](http://geekhack.org/index.php) keys today and installed them
tonight on my work (tenkeyless) and sc2 keyboards.

I started with placing the orange geekhack key, orange space and orange esc key
on the keyboard. I also placed four sc2 race keys as F5-F8 for fun and to match
my sc2 keyboard. The other cool thing I ordered was command keys (since I use
Macs for work). My mod keys are all accuratly labeled (from left to right:
Control, Meta, Command, Space, Command, Meta, Super, Control) with Caps Lock
being labeled a control as well. I LOVE IT. I'm very please. I might put some
blue or orange keys on the keyboard as well but I haven't quite decided.

For now I'm just loving the fact that my keyboard has my Caps Lock :arrow_right:
Control key and all mod keys correctly labeled. I'm really using a meta key no!w
