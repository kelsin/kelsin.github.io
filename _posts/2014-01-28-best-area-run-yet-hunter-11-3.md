Last night I started this hunter deck in arena and it's worked out pretty well so far. Tonight I finished the run with a score of 11-3!

I didn't originally think the deck was that good. I took a LOT of secrets and
ended up taken a bunch of scavenging hyena's which are not my favorite. It turns
out however with so many secrets to protect them... they lived a lot :)

I was able to combo them with my one unleash the hounds, houndmaster and
buzzard.

The last game of the series I lost due to the shaman mind control teching the
right creature... if he didn't do that I would have won.
