<p>Our team finally won a round in ESEA last night. We went 3-2 in total after the ace match. I got paired with a diamond Zerg and actually took him out 2-0 is two of the closest games I've ever played.</p><p>The first game we BOTH went with EGMachine's ZvZ build. The first agression happened near my base while I sent 4 banelings into his. Luckily my banelings did some damage while I was able to move my drones out of the way. I managed to kill two of his banelings with my zerglings (safely) and then got the other two via my queen. I put up two spine crawlers and decided to keep at it with the lings. At one point we both attacked each other at the same time, but I feel my superior building placement, two spines and queen helped keep me a live with about 5 drones while I managed to kill ALL of his drones. After we had some ling fights and I came out on top he gg'd.</p><p>The second game I started with the same build, but he ended up coming at me with ALL of his drones and 6 lings right when I started my lings. He only planted one spine in my creep and I attacked with all of my drones trying to keep them away from his lings and backing off when he did (waiting for my lings to pop). Eventually my lings popped and I ended the fight with 2 lings and about 3 drones left (my queen popping and speed popping for my lings helped a lot).</p><p>At that point I ran to his base and actually micro'd my two lings to kill his 3 drones without a loss. He had two lings pop but I just ran mine away (speed for the win) and got two more lings out (thank god I built those) which allowed me to kill his 2 easily with my 4. At this point he gg'd. He had no drones and I could kill any units that popped in his base while building enough to take out his buildings.</p><p>I was thrilled. After that we were 2-1 (Shane couldn't make it so his forfeit made us 2-2). We picked our terran diamond player to play their diamond zerg player (not the one I faced) in the ace match. He lost the first game and put us on edge, but then won the next two! So finally we have a Baneling Bust team win in ESEA!</p>
