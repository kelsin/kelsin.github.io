I had my annual assessment today. Nothing came as much of a surprise since my
boss and I constantly chat. Due to this I know very accurately where I stand
most of the time (not just at the review). My two main points of improvement at
this point is documentation and negativity.

## Documentation

My external (not in-code) documentation is pretty poor. This point of
improvement is way less important than the next one but is probably far easier
to fix. I write in a conversational manner and write for myself as an
audience. This results in docs that are confusing for anyone without my exact
knowledge set. I want to tackle this in two ways.

First I want to start writing more often. I will never be a great writer but by
writing in this blog daily I hope to get a bit better. Reading a bit more should
also help this type of improvement. I'm going to try a read a little bit each
day as well.

The second way to get better is to focus on documentation a bit more at
work. This will actually be very easy to do since I'm now on a team with two
great programmers. This is going to allow me to focus on git, documentation and
organization a bit more and let the most complicated code work rest on their
shoulders. This should work out great for all of us (I hope) and help me improve
my documentation a bit.

Next time I have to write docs I'm definitely going to get more reviews on it as
well from both people on my team, and random people on my floor. Having someone
without insight into my projects review my docs should help a lot.

## Negativity

I'm extremely passionate about a lot of things. I think my boss accurately
described me as a fanboy of almost everything I'm interested in which is a very
fair assessment. This is often a strength at work due to the fact that I care
greatly about all of my projects and help others feel excited as
well. Unfortunately it can also cause people to feel my anger when other teams
or individuals argue with me, or fail to meet expectations (legitimate or not).
When I was an associate engineer (and an engineer at other jobs) this type of
negativity goes unnoticed a lot more. It's not as much of a problem. When I'm in
the position of being a core member of a team however it can lead to a spread of
negative feelings about people, the project or other teams. Worse than that it
can cause people to associate me with that type of negativity.

Fixing this is harder that just practicing documentation. While being hard
however, it's also a pretty simple process. Right now I'm focusing on two
aspects. I'm first trying to stay more positive at work in general. When other
teams (or individuals) don't meet expectations the fault can often be deeply
routed in many parts of the process that we used to get to that point. It's an
opportunity to fix whatever is failing in this process. A Senior (or Senior II,
or Lead) engineer would use this as a good place to start on improving the
workplace instead of just vocally complaining. This could result in great
strides in my management ability and my influence on where I work which is
exciting. I try to stay focused on this instead of the negatives. It's been
working very well so far.

I'm also trying a reactive approach as well. In many situations if I find myself
being negative I immediately apologize. This includes apologizing to the bullpen
if I get annoyed, and also includes apologizing to individuals if I get short or
snap at someone. Immediately apologizing is embarrassing and has done wonders to
help train myself NOT to get into that situation again. It's also (quite
frankly) improved my relationship with teams and individuals as well. My boss
introduced me to this approach and it's had a LARGE positive effect.

## Goals

Those are the main two improvement points that were part of my official
review. As well as this I have some work goals to go along with my personal
goals for 2014. Here is the full list:

* Improve my documentation by writing more, focusing on documentation and
  getting more documentation reviews.
* Improve my attitude by looking for ways to improve my workplace and
  immediately apologizing for behavior that I don't want to repeat.
* Make sure I'm organized enough to not forget action items. Bullet journal to
  the rescue.
* Focus on avoiding interruptions during certain tasks. Pomodoro should help
  with this!
* Focusing on figuring out even more of the bigger picture and getting things
  done. I'm at the point where I shouldn't have to rely on my boss for many
  things at work. Recognizing these things and acting on them is going to be a
  big focus for me in 2014.
* As always: continue to learn and grow as much as possible. There is a ton for
  me to learn still about Java, the JVM and Spring as well as technologies that
  we don't currently use as work. I feel like this is a strength of mine and
  therefor I need to keep it up!
* Continue to be passionate about what I do and try to spread the positive
  aspects of that passion as much as possible :smile:
