Tonight I installed my custom keys that I ordered from
[Geekhack](http://geekhack.org/index.php).

I had no trouble installing the keys. I used some small bits of plastic bags
under the white stabalizer pieces in any that felt lose and this seems to have
worked wonders. I will be posting about my work keyboard (the tenkeyless) in my
programming blog tomorrow. For now I'll just look at my Sc2 keyboard.

I used two geekhack keys as well as my awesome key for numlock and the 4 race
keys for F5-F8. None of these have anything to do with starcraft. I also used
two zerg mod keys as my windows keys. Other mod keys remain what they really
are. The starcraft parts come from the fact that I used orange to represent all
control group keys and blue to represent view location keys (Plus space which I
use for town hall camera so it's close). This gives a great look that's accurate
to what I use the keys for. I also used the non-nubbed F and J but nubbed the
orange (G) key which I use for my main unit producing buildings. This helps me
find it.

Clearly I can not wait to use this for sc2! Time to start playing again for
sure.
