Switching from [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) (and
[ruby-build](https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build)) to
[chruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby) (and
[ruby-install](https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install)). There isn't a huge
reason for the change other than I like their simplicity and want to try out
something new!

I've updated my
[prompt](https://github.com/kelsin/configs/blob/master/.bash.d/50.prompt.sh#L82)
with chruby support and it now provides ruby, node and git information.

Along with this I'm moving from god to monit on my Linode for monitoring. God
hasn't been very good at correcting problems when they exist... and I haven't
had time to figure it out. Hopefully Monit solves this.
