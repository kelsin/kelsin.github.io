So I've finally started playing again in preperation for the
[NE Sc2 Tourney this saturday](http://www.nesc2league.com/forum/index.php?topic=506.0). I
havn't been playing recently due to anger. I didn't like how mad I got when
playing. I've done many things to try and help this and I think I might have
found something that works. Feel free to email me if you want any more info
about that.

This week I've played some 1v1 on Monday and then for two nights I've done 2v2
and 3v3's against computers with some friends. I think we're almost ready to 2v2
and 3v3 for real however. For me I'm just getting back into the swing of
things. I tried playing with my crazy hotkeys at first and after the first day
of 1v1 I decided to go back to standard (or close to standard) hotkeys. After
the first night of 2v2 I decided that standard keys felt even worse! Last night
I tried my crazy custom keys again and everything seemed to work
fine. Definitely sticking with my crazy keys for the tourney.

I'm hoping to play 1 or 2 1v1's tonight (will be late after board games) and
then I'm definitely going to get some practice in on Friday. Not near enough but
it's all I'm going to get before the tourney.

After Saturday i will definitely post the final pictures of my current keyboard
setup and the keyboard bag that my Mom helped me make!

**Note about mouse acceleration on a Mac**

I've tried many things on my mac in order to work with my steelseries' mice
without acceleration. I finally found
[this steelseries tool](http://steelseries.com/support/downloads#tools). On the
desktop it's working great! I need to try it out later in Sc2 and see if mouse
accerlation during Sc2 is ok. The "Always On" setting of the tool is supposed to
constantly make sure that no software screws with the acceraltion tool. Let's
hope that's true!
