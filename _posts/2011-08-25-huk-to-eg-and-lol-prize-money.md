After listening to this weeks shows I feel the need to express MY pointless
opinion on the interwebs so...

## Huk to EG

This is awesome. Grats to Huk! If you get a life changing deal, you take it. I'm
very happy for him and I'm going to love rooting for Huk and Idra at the next
MLG. I would root for Huk and Idra no matter what teams they played on. When a
team league comes up I think about the teams more, but until then I care more
about the players. I love that there is enough money for stuff like this to
happen.

My problem with it is that there aren't many teams that can do that...
*yet*. This is just a weird time. I think most of the negativity about this
comes from this fact. There aren't many teams that can offer this amount of
money to players. Once more teams get money I think this type of thing will
happen more and I think everyone will benefit.

## League of Legends

Watching LoL is NOTHING like watching sc2. I don't know what the future holds
for these things, but I'm super glad that these companies are able to announce
1-5 million tourneys for MOBAs. The games are exetremely fun to play and clearly
appeal to a lot of people. I still like watching sc2 more since the games are
shorter and cooler and I think more skill is involved. As long as all of esports
continue getting money I think it's awesome.
