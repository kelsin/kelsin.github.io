I've spent the past few weeks redesigning my blog and moving it away from
[Posthaven](https://posthaven.com/) and onto github pages.

I've decided to move away from posthaven since they seem really slow with making
any improvements. I learned that they have no export function, no markdown
support and it wasn't easy to embed things that I wanted to embed. I thought
development would be moving along but it's been three months since any features
were added and that feature was to add one form field to the post editing UI.

I've tried to blog with jekyll before and got obsessed with custom plugins and
hosting on AWS. This time I'm going for a pure github pages blog that is built
on github. This means no custom jekyll code at all. Currently I'm building the
front end files with gulp, but the blog itself builds on github.

The design is based on [other](https://github.com/mmistakes/hpstr-jekyll-theme)
[blog](http://camporez.com/blog/thinny-2/)
[themes](https://github.com/Thomascullen92/Ellie) but was fully made from
scratch so I could experiment with some new front end options. I want to add
custom header images per post which I will be adding over the next few days.

I failed at posting since Febuary so I'm hoping to get back into it :smile:,
we'll see how it goes.
