I was able to catch most of the WWDC keynote today. We watched it in our bullpen
on our projector. I first tried to get work done and eventually gave up and just
watched. Lots of cool stuff on the way.

## Most excited for ...

I'm most excited about [continuity](http://www.apple.com/ios/ios8/continuity/),
the integration between the next version of OSX and iOS. So many times I don't
want to get up to answer my phone... and now I don't have to! Being able to open
my desktop browser to where I was looking on the my phone (and vice-versa)
sounds great.

## Other new features that I will be using

Annotating images in mail sounds amazing. I use a third party app for that right
now and sometimes if I'm lazy I just don't annotate. The ability to annotate in
the app will be a very welcome feature for me.

I will attempt to use the
[new spotlight](http://www.apple.com/osx/preview/design/#spotlight-gallery). If
it's fast I'll ditch
[launchbar](http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html). I mainly use
launchbar for app switching and launching so it's very possible that I'll have
everything I need with the new spotlight. Only time will tell! :smile:

Being able to really SMS message from my laptop is also a welcome feature that I
will use. I LOVE the iMessage integration now, and it will only get better.

I'm also going to try out photos and the new iCloud service and see if I can
drop other software (like Dropbox).

## The big one... Swift

I can't wait to try out switch. I already love playing with programming
languages, and even though I'm a big Objective-C fan... there does come a time
where even great languages get too old. Losing ObjC doesn't mean we lose all of
the great stuff that comes from the NextSTEP runtime.

The new language looks fun, but I'm more eager to learn about Apple's APIs and
dev tools that anything else. I've never really had time to dedicate to that
despite wanting to. Maybe I will in the future! :pray:
