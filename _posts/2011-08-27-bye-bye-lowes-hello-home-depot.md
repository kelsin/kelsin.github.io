title: Bye bye Lowes, Hello Home Depot!

So today in preperation for the hurricane I wanted to buy a new flashlight. When
I went to Lowes the salesguy laughed at me and said "A bit late buddy huh?"...

Is that how customer service works now? On the way out of the store (I
immediately just walked away from the dude) I hear 5 other people asking other
workers the same question and none of them laughed at the customer.

I think from now on I'm going to Home Depot. No one at Lowes acts the way they
do in the commercials. I want to be helped. I want to take your advice and I
want to be treated like I'm not an idiot. Let's hope Home Depot delivers.
