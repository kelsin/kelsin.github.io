<p>After hearing Tyler talk about his hotkey setup it made me want to try and create my own as well. We'll see how it goes.</p><p>I had no idea where to begin so I'm just going to try and solve large groups of functionality.</p><p><strong>My control groups</strong></p><p>I have 1-4 being normal control groups and then Q, A, Z and X also being control groups. While playing zerg I'm going to have hatches on A and and queens on Q. When playing other races I'm going to have town halls on Q and rax on A, fac/robo on Z and star's on X. Unit creation buttons stream from this so raz units are sdf and star/fac/robo units are cvb while the macro ability is E. Zerg creep spread is W (on queen and tumor) and larva inject is E.</p><p><strong>Unit Control</strong></p><p>Right now I put units on 1-4 and us 5 as attack. I don't know if I like this. It can feel clunky. 6 is hold position and ` is patrol. S is stop and M is move (which I don't use). Mainly I can't use A as attack anymore and that's the most ingrained muscle memory I have.</p><p><strong>Abilities and Upgrades</strong></p><p>Abilities are almost always W, E, R and T. R is used for burrow on all zerg units so normal abilities are W, E and T. Upgrades on buildings are ussually on W, E and R or W, E, S and D. Just kind of grid laid out.</p><p><strong>Problems</strong></p><p>I feel like unit control is really hard right now. I don't like 5 as attack but the only "comfortable" button is A. I think this is only muscle memory though and nothing else. I'm going to try and get used to this 5 thing for now.&nbsp;</p><p>I have no idea if this is worth it or not, I feel almost like I should just go back to classic... don't now. Guess I'll try this for a little bit and change it later if I really don't like it.</p>
