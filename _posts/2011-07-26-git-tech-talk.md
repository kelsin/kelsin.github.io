We've started up doing Tuesday Tech Talks at work and I got to go first by
talking about git. We use git to store all of the code I work with.  For the
people working directly with me this was mostly review. The rest of the
co-workers span the gammit on knowledge. For this reason I tried to go pretty
low level in some cases, and also span a huge list of topics. My main goal is
that sometime in the future, when they are using git, they will think of one
part of my presentation and look up the needed info to implement or incorporate
that idea into their work.  Whether it's as simple as rebasing to clean up their
code before commiting it to a dev branch, or adding the git branch name to their
prompt.

I did the presentation in beamer (LaTeX presentation package) and the source is
up [at github](https://github.com/Kelsin/git-presentation).  I'm attaching the
resulting mean pdf here. Feel free to send any pull requests to github if you
have good changes or better ideas for how to format something!
