Originally I had found
[this page](http://java.ociweb.com/mark/programming/tmuxInCygwin.html) describing
how to install Tmux in cygwin and I was able to accomplish this goal with
relative ease. Once I realized that the instructions were dead simple, and that
ncurses and libevent appears to already be included in cygwin I wanted to give
it another go where I only installed tmux itself from source.

I'm using the following alias with [apt-cyg](https://code.google.com/p/apt-cyg/)
for the rest of this post:

``` bash
alias cyg='apt-cyg -m http://mirrors.kernel.org/sources.redhat.com/cygwin/'
```

Then installing tmux was as simple as following this script:

``` bash
# Dependencies
cyg install gcc-core make automake pkg-config libevent-devel ncurses libncursesw-devel

# Now install tmux, I did this in ~/src
git clone http://git.code.sf.net/p/tmux/tmux-code tmux
cd tmux
export INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/local/include/
export LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/
./autogen.sh
./configure
make && make install
```

Now I have a working tmux!

My config for this status bar was generated by a
[vim plugin](https://github.com/edkolev/tmuxline.vim) and you can view my exact
setup by looking at my
[main tmux config file](https://github.com/Kelsin/configs/blob/master/.tmux.conf),
and the
[generated status bar config file](https://github.com/Kelsin/configs/blob/master/.tmux.status.conf
"Link: https://github.com/Kelsin/configs/blob/master/.tmux.status.conf").

The config for the vim plugin that generated this layout:

``` vim
" Don't use airline colors
let g:airline#extensions#tmuxline#enabled = 0

" Colors
let g:tmuxline_theme = {
      \'a'   :["colour15","colour01","bold"],
      \'b'   :["colour15","colour11","bold"],
      \'c'   :["colour10","colour00","bold"],
      \'x'   :["colour10","colour00","bold"],
      \'y'   :["colour15","colour09","bold"],
      \'z'   :["colour15","colour04","bold"],
      \'win' :["colour10","colour00","bold"],
      \'cwin':["colour15","colour13","bold"],
      \'bg'  :["colour00","colour00"]
      \}

" Preset
let g:tmuxline_preset = {
      \ 'a': '#S',
      \ 'win' :'#I:#W #F',
      \ 'cwin':'#I:#W #F',
      \ 'x': '%F',
      \ 'y': '%R',
      \ 'z': '#H',
      \ 'options': {
      \   'status-justify': 'left',
      \   'message-fg': 'colour15',
      \   'message-bg': 'colour00',
      \   'message-attr': 'bold',
      \   'message-command-fg': 'colour15',
      \   'message-command-bg': 'colour01',
      \   'message-command-attr': 'bold' }
      \}
```
