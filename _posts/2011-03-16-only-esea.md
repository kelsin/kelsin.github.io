<p>Havn't gotten enough time to really practice anything recently. I've been playing lots of team games which is probably making my 1v1 worse. I'm also playing the ESEA matches but with no 1v1 practice it really doesn't help.</p><p>I get really furious when I lose 1v1 so I've been avoiding it... which is a problem since I don't get any better. Going to have to try and solve this at some point but not yet.</p>
