Recently when looking up information about front end libraries (Angular, Ember,
etc... will blog about this later on I'm sure) I realized that
[Yehuda Katz](http://yehudakatz.com/) works on a vim config distribution called
[Janus](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus). I've been having a lot of trouble
moving off of IntelliJ onto Emacs at work so I figured it was worth a shot to
try out [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) again.

I've always loved the basic Vim commands. I often used
[Viper mode](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ViperMode) in Emacs. The biggest
hurdle I've found is that I never liked working with multiple files in one Vim
session. Something about the window management never quite worked for me. I'm
giving it another go with an emphasis on solving this issue. Over the weekend
I've beef up my [.vimrc](https://github.com/Kelsin/configs/blob/master/.vimrc)
and installed a large amount of
[plugins](https://github.com/Kelsin/configs/tree/1ba230df7ea860aaea785225bc9cb19833329dfd/.vim/bundle). Starting
on Tuesday (when I'm back at work) I'm going to fool around with getting some
other java stuff working. For now I'm going to see if I can get a rails site up
and running while using Vim.

So over the next few weeks I'm going to try and look at what parts of my .vimrc
are working and which aren't and blog a bit about them. I'm also getting a nice
[solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) theme going with
[airline](https://github.com/bling/vim-airline) which I will screenshot and post
about in a later blog as well!
