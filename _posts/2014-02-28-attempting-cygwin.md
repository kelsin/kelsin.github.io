After much though I'm going to try out Cygwin again. Tomorrow my system at work
gets upgraded which means I have a brand new system to setup. I will try cygwin
first prior to msys and see how far I get.

I plan on trying to
[install tmux](http://java.ociweb.com/mark/programming/tmuxInCygwin.html). I
plan on trying out [apt-cyg](https://code.google.com/p/apt-cyg/). I plan on
using cygwin defaults (root in `C:\cygwin64` and a `/cygdrive/` mount
point). For windowing I'm going to try a bunch of stuff:

- I want to make sure I can get a good version of vim and emacs both running in
  the native w32 gui version of mintty under screen and tmux.
- I want to try out the emacs-w32 binary which uses the native windows gui.
- I want to see if I can get a X session going with XMonad (or FVWM)

We'll see how far I get. I hope to provide screenshots and a status blog
tomorrow afternoon!
