I've had to test a lot of OAuth applications recently and would often need
proper SSL running on localhost for them. When working on tiny little one page
[Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) or [Express](http://expressjs.com/) apps I
didn't want to learn how to setup each framework to use SSL properly so instead
I just use stunnel to do it.

## Installing

To install stunnel I just:

~~~ bash
brew install stunnel
~~~

I then create a quick self-signed certificate to use:

~~~ bash
openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes -out stunnel.pem -keyout stunnel.pem
~~~

## Config

Stunnel is easiest to use with a config file so I write one like the following:

~~~ ini
# stunnel.conf
foreground = yes

[example-app]
connect = 3000
accept = 443
cert = stunnel.pem
~~~

In this file the first option just makes stunnel run in the foreground. Since
I'm only using it for local testing I find this easier. I can close the tunnel
with ctrl-c and don't need to worry about spawning too many processes in the
background or forgetting about one.

The `[example-app]` is just naming a tunnel so this can be whatever you want. I
then specify what port to listen on (`accept`) and what port to connect to
(`connect`). This is my default for most ruby apps. You then link to the cert
file to use (which is the cert you created a second ago).

## Profit

Now I can use `https://localhost` to connect (with SSL) to an app running on a
local port. Easy! If you need a "real" url instead of localhost you can just
edit your hostfile to point any DNS name you want to `127.0.0.1` (sometimes
OAuth providers won't accept localhost as a redirect url for instance).

## Other options

[ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) looks like a great service to use if you need to do
this and aren't working on anything sensitive.
