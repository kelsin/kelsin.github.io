When I got it I also made the horrible decision to try dvorak! Its going slowly to say the least.</p><p>Regardless I love the keyboard! Enter and backspace were made to be under your thumbs for sure. As you can see in the photo I'm also trying out a trackball. Havn't used one of those in years.</p><p>My plan for emacs is not to do anything. I'm just going to use standard keybindings for now. Emacs bindings are already not based on key location so I'm not worried. I'll make a new post if I make any config changes.</p>
