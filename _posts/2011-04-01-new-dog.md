<p>So with Sadie's passing me and Caitlin wasted no time getting another dog. We want someone for Grubby to play with, and want two dogs in general so there was no reason to wait<div class='p_embed p_image_embed'><a href="http://getfile2.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2011-04-01/sublBefmoiDICwtpvHhlhfzkshBmFsqfChpyBccpDAafIlErvbmJvJqilzcv/00372wpg.jpg"><img alt="00372wpg" src="http://getfile2.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2011-04-01/sublBefmoiDICwtpvHhlhfzkshBmFsqfChpyBccpDAafIlErvbmJvJqilzcv/00372wpg.jpg" /></a><a href="http://getfile3.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2011-04-01/qncpiudmIeBleFwkfctiwwucgArHHobCquGxcCajjksbqsollsqErfsEwhAe/s640x480.jpg"><img alt="S640x480" src="http://getfile3.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2011-04-01/qncpiudmIeBleFwkfctiwwucgArHHobCquGxcCajjksbqsollsqErfsEwhAe/s640x480.jpg" /></a></div></p><p>Caitlin did make the fatal mistake of letting me name the dog for the second time. Our first dog is named Grubby after my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FollowGrubby">favorite Warcraft 3 pro player</a>. This dog I decided to name Tcl after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl">the programming language</a> that I've used a lot while programming at Berklee College of Music. Like the wikipedia page says it's pronounced "tickle". It satisfies our requirements of being incredibly geeky, while at the same time being incredibly cute.</p><p>So our new dog Tcl will be spending the next few days getting used to Grubby and our 3 cats!</p>
