Due to my love of board games I've always wanted to get a proper Mahjong set but
they can be pretty expensive. I knew I would want a nice one. When the
[Chinese Warcraft](http://kotaku.com/i-want-chinas-world-of-warcraft-mahjong-set-493102039)
set was announced I was very interested but unfortunately couldn't quite swing
the price tag. Unfortunately at the time I didn't realize that only 1000 were
going to be made, and that our US office was only getting 250 of them to
sell. Luckily I posted on our internal forums and another employee bought one
for a friend who no longer wanted it!

I picked it up today and it was still in it's packing box. Completely unopened!
I was able to open it when I got home!

I can not wait to fully learn the real rules (I learned it a while ago, but
haven't actually played since, so time to relearn) and play using this gorgeous
set. The play mats, the bars, the tiles, the dice, they are all fantastic! I
found my great, high-quality Mahjong set that happens to fit my Blizzard fan-boy
persona perfectly!
