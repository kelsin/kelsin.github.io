Now I can't wait for it to get here.

I finally decided to set my priorities for an audio interface (and upgrading my desktop computer in general)

<ol>
	<li>I wanted it to just work. No more googling to find out if a certain PCMCIA card had a certain revision of a certain firewire chipset.</li>
	<li>I wanted it to be portable. One of the reasons to upgrade is to get a laptop and be able to play my Zendrum live (hopefully)</li>
</ol>

Once deciding on this I decided a 2 channel interface is ok. I'll upgrade and buy a nice multiple channel thing if the need arises later on. For now I only record vocals and guitar so no need for anything complicated. I now started googling for "[audio interface] driver issues" and see what comes up. Two interfaces stuck out as having very glowing reviews and almost no issues coming up in google. Echo Audiofire and Apogee Duet.

When doing more research the AudioFire turns out to not be good with virtual instruments. While being VERY stable it has too much latency. Just a design decision by the makers. The Apogee reviews however have been great. This seems to be the interface to get if you can afford it.

So now things are pretty much set. Apple laptop (I can NOT see myself buying a windows laptop for music, can you?) with Logic Studio (instead of Cakewalk Sonar) and an Apogee Duet.

The plan so far had been to wait until after wedding but I found a loop hole to follow as long as I'm smart. I did the financing option with no interested for 12 months by signing up for a new card. Now if I make small payments on it on time and pay it off in a year, I'm good. Caitlin said she will help me and now I have a new laptop ordered!
