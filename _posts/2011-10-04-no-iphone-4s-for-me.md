title: No iPhone 4S for me...

I would gladly throw my $199 for a new iPhone 4S but according to the apple
store website it would cost me $450 currently due to my contract... I hate cell
phone contracts. So I guess most current iPhone 4 users won't be able to upgrade
at a reasonable price.

**EDIT**: Some other iPhone 4 users have responded via twitter with the same
message. We all have to wait until Feburary if we want to upgrade :frowning:
