Today I played in the 3rd tournement of the second season of the
[New England Sc2 League](http://www.nesc2league.com/). I won my first match and
then lost two in a row. Standard operating procedure pretty much.  The game I
won was a close fight against someone that was equal to me as far as rank
goes. That felt like a nice win. After that the other two games were vs people
that are ranked way higher than me so it makes sense. The best part was that I
got to debut my keyboard bag! My mom made this bag out of fabric that I made via
[Fabric on Demand](http://www.fabricondemand.com/). It's made to only carry my
full size

keyboard along with my mouse, headset and mousepad. It works perfect and looks
amazing!

The first match was with a platinum random player and I won the first ZvP after
defending his 4 gate. The next game was a ZvZ and went from ling/bling wars into
roach wars. He then tried to transition to muta but I was able to out macro and
kill him. Sweet Victory!

The next match was vs a masters player that just beat Boyo. I did not have high
hopes and both ZvZ's ended very quickly during the bling wars.  The last match
was vs a very good terran player. The first game I died to tanks and marines
with helions by him making me multitask! The second game was crazy but ended in
a base trade and since I didn't have air yet, base trading doesn't work :-(

Hopefully I'll do better at the next tournament with some good practice!
