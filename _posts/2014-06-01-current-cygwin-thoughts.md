After trying out [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) for a while at work I have
decided that I will keep using it on any Windows machines that I need to program
on. That being said I found Emacs's performance is very lacking so I'm not 100%
sure on which method I'll use to run Emacs in Windows.

## Why?

I love [tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/)... and using it is worth dealing
with any weird Cygwin issues. Terminal performance is perfectly fine and all of
my java programs work fine when running from Cygwin. Having a sane terminal is
worth the slight awkwardness between the Cygwin environment and the normal
Windows environment. Colors just work and my current home directory setup just
works in cygwin much easier.

I haven't had near as many programs with Cygwin as I've had in the past which is
very nice. It's really a weird performance issue which is the problem. I haven't
finished fully trying to solve these problems either. There might be a good
solution to getting the Cygwin Emacs working (I am using the native gui version
currently, and haven't really tried a full X11 environment in Windows yet).

## Future at Work

Luckily the web team is moving towards using Macbooks... so I won't need to
worry about this for much longer. I can not wait! :thumbsup:
