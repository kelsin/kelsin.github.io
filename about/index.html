      <h2>Life</h2>
      <p>
        I live in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Irvine,+CA/" title="Map of Irvine, CA">Irvine, CA</a>
        with my wife Caitlin, my daughter Kerrigan, my two dogs (Grubby and Tcl),
        and my three cats (Lily, Blurry and Maeby).
      </p>
      <p>
        I became a dad on August 26th, 2014. Since then my wife and I have been
        balancing being new parents with our other interests! I can not wait for
        Kerrigan to get old enough that I can learn about what she's interested in.

      <h2>Games</h2>
      <p>
        I tend to play a few games for a long time (very different from my wife's
        habbits). I've always been a very big fan of Blizzard games and have been
        playing them for most of my life. I can also be found on League of Legends
        (I've spent far too much money on League!)
